# 🚀 Elasticsearch Mini-Projects (2 Days)

Welcome to your Elasticsearch challenge!  
You’ll build a small project that demonstrates the power of **search and analytics**. Each project is scoped so you can finish it in **two days**.  



## 📌 What You’ll Learn
- How to **index data** into Elasticsearch  
- How to perform **full-text search** and **filters**  
- How to run **aggregations** (counts, stats, histograms)  
- How to design a small **search/analytics use case** like in real-world apps  



## 📂 Project: pick one!

### 1. 🎬 Movie Search Engine
**Dataset**: [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) or [IMDB dataset](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) 

**Must-have**  
- Index movies with title, description, genre, release year, rating  
- Search by title or keywords in description  
- Filter by genre or year  
- Sort by rating or popularity  

**Nice-to-have**  
- “Similar movies” with `more_like_this`  
- Autocomplete on movie titles  
- Vector search for movie plot embeddings  



### 2. 📰 News Article Finder
**Dataset**: [BBC news](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/bbc-news) dataset (Kaggle) or any open news dataset  

**Must-have**  
- Index articles with title, body, author, category, date  
- Search by keywords in the article body  
- Filter by author or category  
- Show most recent results  

**Nice-to-have**  
- Aggregations: number of articles per category, top authors  
- Highlighting of matched keywords in search results  
- Vector search for semantic similarity between articles  



### 3. 🛒 E-commerce Product Search
**Dataset**: Kaggle [Amazon products](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/amazon-products-dataset-2023-1-4m-products) dataset or mock product catalog  

**Must-have**  
- Index products with name, description, category, price, brand, rating  
- Keyword search in product title/description  
- Filters: price range, brand, rating  
- Sorting by price or rating  

**Nice-to-have**  
- Autocomplete for the search bar  
- Aggregations: average rating by brand, most common categories  
- Vector search for product description embeddings  



### 4. 📊 Log Analysis Dashboard (Mini-ELK)
**Dataset**: Sample [Apache](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishnu0399/server-logs) or [Web Server](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eliasdabbas/web-server-access-logs) log files  

**Must-have**  
- Index logs with fields: timestamp, status code, IP, URL  
- Find all errors (`status >= 400`)  
- Search logs by URL pattern  

**Nice-to-have**  
- Aggregations: requests per status code, per hour, top IPs  
- Visualization in [Kibana](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kibana/index.htm) (time series or pie charts)  
- Alerting (simulated) for error spikes  



### 5. 🎵 Spotify Music Explorer
**Dataset**: [Spotify Tracks dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset)  

**Must-have**  
- Index tracks with title, artist, album, genre, year, and audio features  
- Search by song title or artist  
- Filter by year, genre, or album  

**Nice-to-have**  
- Aggregations: average danceability/energy per genre, most common genres  
- “Find similar songs” with `more_like_this`  
- Vector search for music embeddings (e.g., based on audio features)  



## ✅ Deliverables

1 repository and your code and queries should follow **clean coding practices**:  
- Use meaningful variable names  
- Add docstrings to functions  
- Organize queries in reusable functions  
- Avoid hardcoding values unnecessarily  

### 🌟 Nice-to-Have
If you finish early or want to explore advanced features:  
- Implement **autocomplete** for search input  
- Use the **“did you mean”** feature for misspelled queries  
- Add **advanced aggregations** (e.g., histograms, percentiles)  
- Visualize results in [Kibana](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kibana/index.htm) or a custom web UI  
- Try **vector search** if your dataset supports embeddings for similarity queries  



👉 Choose **one project idea** that excites you. Keep it simple but complete!
